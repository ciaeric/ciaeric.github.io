### <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Profile

Hi there, my name is Eric Dong, and my Chinese Name is 董经纬. The reason why I picked Eric as my English Name is because of [**_Eric Clapton_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton) and his song <i class="fa fa-youtube-play" aria-hidden="true"></i> [**_Tears in Heaven_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPj3GAYYZ0), though we were born in totally different ages.

I moved to Australia from the China Mainland in 2015. Currently I am living in Brisbane which is located in Queensland -<i class="fa fa-map-marker" aria-hidden="true"></i> [**_The Sunshine State_**](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Brisbane+QLD)
