I’ve been struggling to get an Australia Map with _Label_ in **Power BI**, finally I crack it and I just want to share my experience to you guys.

---

### Limitations and Problems I met:

1. Existing Map function in Power BI can’t show label.
2. Packages like `map`, `worldmap` supported by Power BI service have NO Australia state boundaries data.
3. `oz package` in R includes state boundaries data, BUT Power BI service doesn’t support this package, and we can’t directly use it with `ggplot2`.
4. Drawing a map in R-studio is all good with prepared map data, but the map is teared up in Power BI by using the same code.

### Step1: Collect Australia state/coast boundaries data

Based on a lot of googling, I find this great [**post**](https://www.elaliberte.info/code), _Etienne Laliberté_ has already helped us to converted `ozRegion()` data to a data frame that can be used in `ggplot2`, which is super. So, download `ozdata.csv` file.

Becuase There is no ACT state boundaries in this data, I found official ACT data from [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/dataset/act-state-boundary-psma-administrative-boundaries). I spent a lot of efforts here to convert `shp` to `csv` file here, all failed. If you understand this kind of data type conversion, just use it.

You can also consolidate an Australia map based on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au) directly.

#### What I did are

- **Click the third link to get JSON file**
![Download JSON file from data.gov.au](/assets/img/post1/l2.png)
![JSON file](/assets/img/post1/l3.png)
- **Convert JSON to CSV**  
I used an [online conversion tool](https://json-csv.com/) to do the job, just easily copy and paste.

- **Merge the file**  
Copy Column F and G to `Ozdata` Long and Lat column, keep the same order as you download the converted file
![Merge in Excel](/assets/img/post1/l4.png)
Fill **group** column with `8`; fill **order** column from `1` to the end of this group; fill **region** as `ACT`; fill **border** as `ACT.NSW`
![Fill Result](/assets/img/post1/l5.png)   
Till this step, I generated a complete **Australian state/coast boundaries data**.

- **Test in R-studio**  
```R
>library("ggplot2")
>ggplot()+geom_polygon(data=ozdata_with_ACT,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group,fill=region))
```

Don’t have `ggplot2` library? Just type `install.packages(“ggplot2”)` in R-studio

### Step2: Prepare label position data

The logic of labelling the map is overlaying two layers. If we want to overlay a label to map, we need get one position in each state which is the coordinates (long,lat), so we need create a csv file and upload to Power BI as below screenshot. 

I slightly changed the long and lat for ACT, NSW and VIC, because they are very close and the labels will be overlaid by each other.

**Then, all the external data are ready!**

### Step 3: Prepare your data.

Because the state in map data is not unique, to avoid multi-multi join, I create a calculated table
```DAX
MapNumber = SUMMARIZE('Member Detail','Member Detail'[State Name],"Members",sum('Member Detail'[NumberofMember]))
```

### Step 4: Build up relationship between datasets

### Step 5: Start your R coding journey

Insert R tile in Power BI, and select the data we need  
![datafiled](/assets/img/post1/l9.png)
![R editor](/assets/img/post1/l10.png)

**Coding in R script editor**
```R
#Load ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)
#Order dataset!! this is the step I have been struggling for a very long time, if there is no order the map you get will be teared up
new<- dataset[order(dataset$group,dataset$order),]

#Power Bi will consolidate all data as one data frame, to improve performance, create a label data frame with unique label position and content data.

label<- unique(dataset[,c("Statemembers","lat.1","long.1")])

#Draw the map layer, using “scale_fill_gradient” to select the colour you want to show in the heat map

ggplot()+geom_polygon(data=new,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group,fill=Members), colour="white")+expand_limits(x = new$long, y = new$lat) +coord_map()+ scale_fill_gradient( low = "#add8e6", high = "#466BB4")

#Draw the label layer

+geom_label(data=label,aes(x=long.1, y=lat.1), colour="#4A4A49", fill="white", label=label$Statemembers, size=4)

#Theme, I like pure white and clean background, you could configure your own one you like

+theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "white"))+ theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white",colour="white"))+ theme(

 panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),

 panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),

 panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),

 panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()

 )+    labs(x=NULL, y=NULL) +  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) + theme(axis.text = element_blank())+ guides(fill=FALSE)
```
Then I got this, the problem is I can hardly tell the difference between states except QLD from the color  
![map1](/assets/img/post1/l12.png)

What I did is to modify the map layer as

```R
ggplot()+geom_polygon(data=new,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group,fill=log(Members)), colour="white")+expand_limits(x = new$long, y = new$lat) +coord_map()+ scale_fill_gradient( low = "#add8e6", high = "#466BB4")
```

Let’s have a look at the final output.

Have Fun!
